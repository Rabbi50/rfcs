# Drop support for Safari < v14.1 

## Summary

Until v14.1, Safari doesn't support:
- private class fields: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_classes_private_class_fields

Other features in the ecosystem,

class static initialization blocks:
- Safari 16.4: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_classes_static_initialization_blocks

This RFC is not concerned with static initialization blocks, as those can easily be transpiled without adding a a lot of code.

## Motivation

Private class fields transpilation has a big impact on the kind of code emitted. We want to transpile as little as possible -- ideally nothing, and let app users decide if they need to transpile further.

## Detailed design

Ember v6 will not support Safari < v14.1


> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Ember patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Ember guides must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how Ember is taught to new users
at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Ember
users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Ember,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
